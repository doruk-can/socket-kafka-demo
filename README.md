# **Applications Overview**

## 1. Data Generator Application

This is the `DataGeneratorApplication` that generates random data and sends it to a socket. This application creates random data containing a timestamp, a random integer (0-100), and the hash of these values, which is then sent over the socket.

## 2. Socket Listener Application

This is the `SocketListenerApplication` that listens to data from a socket, filters the data, and either sends it to Kafka or appends it to a file. The application checks if the random integer value is above 90â€”if it is, the data is sent to Kafka, otherwise, it is written to a file.

## 3. Consumer Application

This is the `ConsumerApplication` that listens to Kafka events and processes data by storing it in MongoDB.
